ENG: 
Documentation below contains instructions, on how to prepare the tests used for the WSLDA project purposes. Testing system
performs all given tests according to the order set by the user, and then generates a report based on the results of the simulations.

Tests can be prepared on the local machine, yet due to requirements of working memory, to be run actual calculations,
access to the computing cluster is highly recomended.

The WSLDA project relies on the cold-atoms repository, which includes the testsuite directory. Testsuite's directory is
working folder and all tests should be placed there.  Path: home2/scratch/knfk/cold-atoms/testsuite

Preparation of the test list:
===========================
1. In the path home2/scrach/knfk/cold-atoms/testsuite prepare a text file named: "tlist".
2. The "tlist" file contains information about the tests that the User intends to perform.
3. Comments can be placed in he "tlist" file. Each comment is preceded by a hash sign (#). Hash sign is MANDATORY.
4. The name of the test is elective. It is forbidden to use any special character other than dot "." or underscore "_".
5. Test names must be written with a string. Using underscores is possible.
6. Each subsequent test must start from a new line in the "tlist" file. One line for one test is MANDATORY.

Sample "tlist" file format:
===============================
# User: John
# Date: 01/01/1970

# The test below is the first test that testsuite will execute.
first_test
# Here is the next test that the User wants to perform.
second_test
# The test below will be executed as well:
third_test # despite the comment left after the name of the test


fourth_testtt # this test will also run despite a comment or two blank lines left above
# test_fifth # this test will NOT run due to the comment sign (#)
# test_six will fail either

end # this will be considered as a test to run
#end # this will not be considered as a test to run


Preparation of the test folder:
===============================
1. After preparing the "tlist" file in the testsuite directory, User has to prepare tests to perform.
2. Each subsequent test must be placed in a different folder. Another test is another folder.
3. Each folder name must match the name of the test given in "tlist".
(So, according to the example, the folder names are: first_test, second_test, third_test, fourth_testtt, end)
4. Each folder must contain a text file "test_desc". "Test_desc" contains a list of Unix commands to be run.
    The format of the text file "test_desc" is shown in the image below.
5. The file "test_desc" contains assigned tags depending on the purpose:
    - "tag" - refers to the name of test
    - "exec" - is the command to be executed, by the testing system in the terminal
    - "diff" - option telling the system that the test is over and ready for comparing the output values with the reference values


Start testing:
=======================
1. Switch directory to: /home2/scratch/knfk/cold-atoms/testsuite
2. Make sure that all folders (tests) are included, according to the "tlist" file.
3. Make sure that all folders (tests) contain the necessary files, including the description file "test_desc".
4. If everything has been prepared correctly, run the test script with the command: ./knfk_test.py
5. After the script is done, a text report will be received in the format: user_data_hour, so that every user could recognize his test


Obtained report:
====================
1. The report will be generated regardless of the correctness of the test execution.
2. The report will be performed only at the very end of the script operation. Interrupting the program will provide no results.
3. The report is in the format of a 5-column text file: | Folder | Tag | Make | Run | Check |
    Folder - name of the test
    Tag - a short description of the test
    Make - returns a boolean value: 'OK' or 'FAIL'. The value 'OK' will be obtained when the compiler creates the executable "-wslda-" file.
    Run - returns a boolean value: 'OK' or 'FAIL'. The value 'OK' will be obtained when the file '-wslda-' will be performed succesfully.
    Check - returns a logical value: 'OK' or 'FAIL'. 'OK' will be returned when ALL output values have been compared with reference
             are within the tolerance specified by the reference file.

After obtaining a report, it is recommended to copy it to your local device and remove from the testsuite directory.
